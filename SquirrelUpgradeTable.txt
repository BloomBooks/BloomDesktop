# The "live" version of this file lives at http://bloomlibrary.org/channels/SquirrelUpgradeTable.txt.
# Changes must be manually uploaded by the Bloom team
# This is a kind of dispatch table that allows us to control which version we recommend to people, based on what they are running now.
# the format is min,max,url.
# The url is for a folder which should contain Squirrel delta files and a RELEASES file which describes how to update to the most recent.
# This was first used by version 3.1, so earlier versions do not use it.
# For now everything uses the 3.1 folder
