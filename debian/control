Description: Literacy materials development for language communities
 Bloom Desktop is an application that dramatically "lowers the bar" for
 language communities who want books in their own languages. Bloom delivers
 a low-training, high-output system where mother tongue speakers and their
 advocates work together to foster both community authorship and access to
 external material in the vernacular.
