 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
     derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
     literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
     be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
     recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
     constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
     Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
     synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
     ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
     this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
     such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms
     or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
     listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
     License.
  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
     and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale
     or other transfer of ownership.
  d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
     work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
     the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the
     publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the
     actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
     sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
     literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
     case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
     who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
     broadcast.
  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
     terms of this License including without limitation any production in
     the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the
     mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a
     book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
     other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;
     a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
     composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
     are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
     cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
     are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
     photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
     sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
     architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
     compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
     work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the
     extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
  g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
     and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
     means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
     digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
     a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place
     and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to
     the public by any means or process and the communication to the
     public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
     performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means
     including signs, sounds or images.
  i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
     including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the
     right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including
     storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or
     other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
     Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
     incorporated in Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
 limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
     terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
     ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
     to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
     sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
     this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
     the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
     that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
     applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
     not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
     subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
     as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
     above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed
     toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The
     exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital
     file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for
     or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
     compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
     compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
     or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
     the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
     supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
     another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
     entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
     Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
     means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
     if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
     such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
     information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
     the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work
     in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
     Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
     The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
     reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
     Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
     credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
     appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
     prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
     avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
  d. For the avoidance of doubt:
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
         jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
         any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
         royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
         this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves
         the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
         by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise
         of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise
         waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License
         that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).
  e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
     or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
     be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
     Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
     any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
     (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
     mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
     the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
     or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
     permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
     (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
 THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
 DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
 LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
     survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
     Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
     Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
     amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
     WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
     Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
     July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
     relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
     enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
     law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
     License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
     License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
     rights under applicable law.

Copyright: 2001-2010 Mike Krueger, John Reilly
License: GPL-2 with exception
 The library is released under the GPL with the following exception:
 .
 Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
 combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
 GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 .
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
 permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
 executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and
 to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
 provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms
 and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a
 module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this
 library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but
 you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
 exception statement from your version.
 .
 Note: The exception is changed to reflect the latest GNU Classpath
 exception. Older versions of #ziplib did have another exception, but the new
 one is clearer and it doesn't break compatibility with the old one.
 .
 Bottom line: In plain English this means you can use this library in
 commercial closed-source applications.
