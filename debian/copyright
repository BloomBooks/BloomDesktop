Copyright: 2001-2010 Mike Krueger, John Reilly
License: GPL-2 with exception
 The library is released under the GPL with the following exception:
 .
 Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
 combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
 GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 .
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
 permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
 executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and
 to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
 provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms
 and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a
 module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this
 library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but
 you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
 exception statement from your version.
 .
 Note: The exception is changed to reflect the latest GNU Classpath
 exception. Older versions of #ziplib did have another exception, but the new
 one is clearer and it doesn't break compatibility with the old one.
 .
 Bottom line: In plain English this means you can use this library in
 commercial closed-source applications.

 The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to

.
 ## Fair Use
.
 You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
 law. These terms do not limit them.
.
 ## No Other Rights
.
 These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
 your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
 granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
 any other licenses.
.
 ## Patent Defense
.
 If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
 contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
 for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
 your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
 immediately for work on behalf of your company.
.
 ## Violations

 The first time you are notified in writing that you have

 not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
 continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
 and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
 32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
 end immediately.

 ## No Liability
