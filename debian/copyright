Copyright: 2001-2010 Mike Krueger, John Reilly
License: GPL-2 with exception
 The library is released under the GPL with the following exception:
 .
 Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
 combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
 GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 .
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
 permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
 executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and
 to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
 provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms
 and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a
 module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this
 library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but
 you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
 exception statement from your version.
 .
 Note: The exception is changed to reflect the latest GNU Classpath
 exception. Older versions of #ziplib did have another exception, but the new
 one is clearer and it doesn't break compatibility with the old one.
 .
 Bottom line: In plain English this means you can use this library in
 commercial closed-source applications.
