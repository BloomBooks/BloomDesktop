            Override this for any reason you like, including if the built-in one (http://ipecho.net/plain) stops working some day.
            The service should simply return a page with a body containing the ip address alone.

            <summary>
            Used to send id information to analytics; the most natural way to use this is to load
            it from your Settings.Default each time you run, even if you don't know these things
            yet because the user hasn't registered yet. Then even if they register while offline,
            eventually this informatino will be sent when they *are* online.
