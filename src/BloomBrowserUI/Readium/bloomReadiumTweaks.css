/* These rules hide some Readium controls.
    - aboutButt1 hides a button displaying Readium which brings up an About box.
    - #btn-expand-audio hides a button with various audio controls. We might want the volume control...then need to think about saving the setting...and hiding less useful controls
    - .icon-shareUrl hides a button used for sharing the URL. Since it's a local, temporary URL and useless to anyone else this we will never want.
    - Not hiding this anymore: #settbutt1 hides a setting button. The font size setting might be useful, but for some reason it doesn't work in Bloom books. Many other things to hide inside the panel.
