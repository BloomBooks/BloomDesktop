/* note, we can't get at the style of the dialog itself, because it isn't in the scope that activates this css
If we wer ever motivated enough to do that, see here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2199888/custom-css-scope-and-jquery-ui-dialog-themes
But more likely we'd just get a Bloom Dialog theme going and so we wouldn't care about customizing it just for this chooser
div.ui-dialog div.ui-dialog-titlebar {
  background: darkgray;
}
