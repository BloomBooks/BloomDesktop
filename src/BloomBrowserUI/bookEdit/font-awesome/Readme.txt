The files in this folder are a subset of the standard download of font-awesome 4.03, from http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/, licensed under the SIL Font license.

Since we only need this to work in our embedded FF (gecko) browser, I only kept the smallest font that worked.
Since we're using them in very simple ways, I was able to delete a lot of other files too.

The font is still a complete one. Since we're only using 4 characters from it, in principle it should be possible to make a smaller file.
My first attempt (using fontello, http://fontello.com/) did not work, even though I attempted to give the characters the same names and code points as font-awesome expects, and even gave the font file the same name. I just got boxes.
