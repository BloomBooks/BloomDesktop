// This file contains code for playing audio in a bloom page, including a draggable page.
// The file is designed to be shared between Bloom Desktop and Bloom Player. Maybe eventually
// as an npm module, but for now, just copied into both projects. See comments in dragActivityRuntime.ts.

// It is quite difficult to know how to handle audio in a drag activity page.
// We need to be able to play it both during "Play" and when showing the page in BP.
// The code in this file so far represents a reuniting of the original Bloom Player
// narration code with the code developed for narration in drag activities.
// There is existing code for playing audio in Bloom Desktop, but it is entangled with the
// code that manages audio recording and the talking book tool. I hope eventually
// this code, or parts of it, can be used there as well as in 'Play' mode.
// The code here has hooks and some methods which are only useful to BP, for things such as
// autoplay and page advance, and also cases where the text being played is
// not fully visible. It deals with pause and continue, which also interact with
// the Bloom Player controls and with video and background music.
// Drag activities added the need to handle situations where the audio on the page
// should not all be played in succession, and more complicated sequencing of audio
// and video

import LiteEvent from "./event";

// that can be shared with BloomDesktop.
