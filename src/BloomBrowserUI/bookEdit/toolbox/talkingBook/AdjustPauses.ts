//Given an initial guess at the sentence breaks, adjustPausesToQuietestNearby looks for the quietest point near each projected break
//  and returns a copy of initialSegments with the splits moved accordingly
//It does this by searching a given fraction of both segments that border a split point, splitting that fraction up into sub-intervals of a given length
//  and evaluating sub-intervals to find the one most likely to represent a sentence break.
//  currently that evaluation is done by finding the sub-interval with the smallest maximum amplitude.

//Enhance: Consider whether swapping out that evaluation function would improve our algorithm's accuracy
//also consider giving sub-intervals a higher weight if they're closer to the initial guess.
//we might also consider whether we can stretch the quiet spot as wide as possible, then place our split int the middle.

//This constant determines how far from the initial splits the method will look for a quiet point.
//For example, if kSegmentFractionToExamine = 0.3, then we'll look at 30% of the segments to either side of the split point
const kSegmentFractionToExamine = 0.3;
