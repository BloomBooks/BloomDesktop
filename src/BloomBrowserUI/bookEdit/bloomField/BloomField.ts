// This class is actually just a group of static functions with a single public method. It does whatever we need to to make Firefox's contenteditable
// element have the behavior we need.
//
// For example, we have trouble with FF's ability to show a cursor in a box that has an :after content but no text content. So here we work around
// that.
//
// Next, we need to support fields that are made of paragraphs. But FF *really* wants to just use <br>s,
// which are worthless because you can't style them. You can't, for example, do paragraph indents or have :before content.
// So the first thing we do here is to work-around that limitation. So we prepare for working in paragraphs, keep you in paragraphs while
// editing, and make sure all is ok when you leave.
//
// Next, our field templates need to have embedded images that text can flow around. To allow that, we have to keep the p elements *after* the image elements, even
// if visually the text is before and after the text (because that's how the image-pusher-downer technique works (zero-width, float-left
// div of the height you want to push the image down to). We do this by noticing a 'bloom-keepFirstInField' class on some div encapsulating the image.
//
// Next, we have to keep you from accidentally losing the image placeholder when you do ctrl+a DEL. We prevent this deletion
// for any element marked with a 'bloom-preventRemoval' class.
