Sliders work
Adding boxes works
Removing boxes work until you have only one left,
 then strange things happen when you add again

To do:
 Replace buttons with dashed line
 Change slider to only be triggered in the middle and indicate visually
 Fix bug when removing too many boxes
 Tidy up code (lots of room for improvement here)
 Integrate with a bloom page
