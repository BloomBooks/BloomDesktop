		//- Must be loaded AFTER pageControlsBundle.js. We are violating our usual practice
		//- here of only having one root bundle per page. Anything pageControlsBundle.js
		//- exports will NOT be accessible through FrameExports, as usual, because
		//- pageThumbnailListBundle.js will overwrite it. That's OK because
		//- pageControlsBundle.js is built from pageControls.tsx which doesn't export anything.
		//- If it ever does export anything we need to access from C# or some other Iframe,
		//- we should reorganize this page to have a single bundle.
