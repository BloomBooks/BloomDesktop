In order to release a new Custom XMatter pack:
1. Update the version number in the 'description-en.txt' file.
   The version will be the first few characters of the file, e.g. "[V2]".
2. Create a bloom pack by zipping up the compiled folder found at:
   {repo}/output/browser/templates/customXMatter/{Your XMatter Folder}
   Place your folder in a new folder also named {Your XMatter Folder}
   Zip the new folder and change the extension to .BloomPack.
   For example, "MXB Pamphlet XMatter-v5.BloomPack" contains folder "MXB Pamphlet XMatter"
   which contains the compiled files from {repo}/output/browser/templates/customXMatter/MXB Pamphlet XMatter.
3. Send the BloomPack to testers via Dropbox or GoogleDrive.
4. Send the BloomPack to the user via Dropbox or GoogleDrive (or attach it to a YouTrack issue and 'at' mention
   the user).

[Steve McC. is writing up an issue (BL-4681) to simplify this by having an Advanced feature UI somewhere
 in the Bloom settings that allows the user to use custom XMatter packs that are stored in this section of
 Bloom's repo.]
