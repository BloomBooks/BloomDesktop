In order to release a new Custom XMatter pack:
1. Update the version number in the 'description-en.txt' file.
   The version will be the first few characters of the file, e.g. "[V2]".
2. Create a bloom pack by zipping up the compiled folder found at:
   {repo}/output/browser/templates/customXMatter/{Your XMatter Folder}
   Place your folder in a new folder also named {Your XMatter Folder}
   Zip the new folder and change the extension to .BloomPack.
   For example, "MXB Pamphlet XMatter-v5.BloomPack" contains folder "MXB Pamphlet XMatter"
   which contains the compiled files from {repo}/output/browser/templates/customXMatter/MXB Pamphlet XMatter.
3. Send the BloomPack to testers via Dropbox or GoogleDrive.
4. Send the BloomPack to the user via Dropbox or GoogleDrive (or attach it to a YouTrack issue and 'at' mention
   the user).

However, note the following for the Afghan xmatters (Dari and Pashti):
I (AP) tried to give SIL LEAD updated packs following the above in May 2020.
They said they ended up with two packs installed because the previous version had been
given to them with the customXMatter subfolder included at the top level.
So I'm now delivering it the same way.
(i.e. I make a copy of customXMatter, clean out irrelevant files, right-click customXMatter, "Send to" -> "compressed (zipped) folder".)
It does have the advantage of allowing for only one BloomPack file needed to distribute all 4 Afghan packs.

A possible enhancement to Bloom would be some Easter egg or check box which would make these custom xmatter packs available directly.
