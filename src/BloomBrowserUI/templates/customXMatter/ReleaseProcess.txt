In order to release a new Custom XMatter pack:
1. Update the version number in the 'description-en.txt' file.
   The version will be the first few characters of the file, e.g. "[V2]".
2. Create a bloom pack by zipping up the compiled folder found at:
   {repo}/output/browser/templates/customXMatter/{Your XMatter Folder}
   Place your folder in a new folder also named {Your XMatter Folder}
   Zip the new folder and change the extension to .BloomPack.
   For example, "MXB Pamphlet XMatter-v5.BloomPack" contains folder "MXB Pamphlet XMatter"
   which contains the compiled files from {repo}/output/browser/templates/customXMatter/MXB Pamphlet XMatter.
3. Send the BloomPack to testers via Dropbox or GoogleDrive.
4. Send the BloomPack to the user via Dropbox or GoogleDrive (or attach it to a YouTrack issue and 'at' mention
   the user).

A possible enhancement to Bloom would be some Easter egg or check box which would make these custom xmatter packs available directly.
