		//- note that these pages are NOT numbered. This is unusual for insertable pages, but we don't
		//- want them in the printed output so the numbering of other pages should not be affected.
		//- Enhance: we need to figure out a way to handle localization.
		//- One option is to localize by adding resular xlf ids (i18n="EditTab.AddPageDialog.CC.EnterQuestions")) to each block.
		//- But then we have to mess with injecting it, and end up with multiple Basic Book-xx.htm files, and have to pick the
		//- right one to show, and the book created from the template will only have the instructions in one language
		//- which could be a nuisance later.
		//- A more desirable outcome would be that the one Basic Book.htm contains all the localizations in a (non-editable)
		//- translation group, and all of them get copied into any shell that is made with CQs, and the right one(s) are displayed
		//- in the usual way. It's not obvious how that fits into our crowdin approach to getting the localizations, though.
		//- Then again, we may end up with a special affordance for creating CQ pages and localizing a page of Basic Book will
		//- not be a problem after all.
		//- Yet another option is to have one or more placeholders for the instructions here and have the
		//- Add Page dialog code insert localizations.
