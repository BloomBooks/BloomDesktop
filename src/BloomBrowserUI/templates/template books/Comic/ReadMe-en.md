## Limitations of Bloom’s current comic book support
- Epub readers are unlikely to show comics correctly.
- While Bloom 4.7 does allow recording audio for comic bubbles, it does not have a way of letting you define the playback order of the bubbles. This is coming soon.
- If you change the paper-size or layout of a book, bubbles will get messed up and you’ll have to fix them.
- The text in bubbles is currently limited to a rectangle, rather than conforming to the actual outlines of the bubble. You can use &lt;enter&gt; to manually break lines. Your comic will look more professional if you take the time to resize bubbles to be as tight as possible.
- You cannot make comic books that show multiple languages on an image at the same time.
- Even if a comic book contains multiple languages (as sources), users cannot switch between languages in Bloom Reader, the web, etc.
- Only one version of bubble size and placement is stored in a book. Yet each time a comic is used for a different language, bubble sizes and locations will need to be adjusted. So if you if you get bubbles just right for, e.g., English, then go work on Spanish and then switch back to English, the bubble sizes and locations will again have to be adjusted.
- We are still exploring to some extent how to get the best possible appearance of a specified type of bubble and tail around a specified block of text. This could result in subtle changes in the appearance of a bubble from one version of Bloom to another.

## Tips on adapting existing comic images to Bloom device format
Unless the original image is already 16x9 in proportion, you have several choices:
1. Crop a portion of it to 16x9.
1. Leave it in its original proportion and let Bloom fill in black around the edges that appear when it is shrunk to fit 16x9.
1. Crop it to something else and let Bloom fill in black around the edges that appear when it is shrunk to fit 16x9.
1. Create a 16x9 rectangle in your graphics program and place the image within it. This allows you to place all the padding on one side or the other, rather than leaving it to Bloom to center the image. This can be useful for creating enough space for a caption.

## Tips on using the Comic Toolbox
- When the comic tool is open and you have already selected an image, Bloom hides the normal picture-changing buttons so that they don’t get the way of working with bubbles. If you need to change the image, first close the Toolbox so that these buttons become available again.
- To move a bubble, click on the hand icon, or CTRL-drag anywhere in the bubble.
- To resize a bubble, move your mouse cursor to the little resize icon, or ALT-drag anywhere in the bubble.
- In the rare case that you need to change the curve of a bubble tail, drag the circle that is in the middle of the tail. It will become a solid color to indicate that you have left “auto mode”. To return to “auto mode”, double click that circle.

## Tips on “lettering”
*“Lettering”* is the term used for adding bubbles and text to comics. Take some time to learn what professional *letterers* say about making a good looking comics. Bloom takes care of some of these things for you, but there are many things that require training your eye. See https://blambot.com/pages/lettering-tips.  Note, you do *not* need to only use upper case letters. It does look cool because we are used to seeing comics done this way, but you should do whatever is best for your audience. If you do choose upper case *and* have a script that is widely supported, consider using a special comic book font.
