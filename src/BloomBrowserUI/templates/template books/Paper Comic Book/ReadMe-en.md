## About Full Bleed
This template tells Bloom that this book is a candidate for "[full bleed](https://dw-wp.com/resources/cartooning-quickguides/layout-quickguides/quickguides-bleeds/)" printing by a printshop. This feature is available in Enterprise Mode. If this feature is enabled, then in the Edit tab, you will see semi-opaque borders. The outer one is the "bleed"; this is area that will probably be cut off by a printshop. The inner border is an area that *might* be cut off, so you should avoid putting things in there that would look really bad if they were cut off. To actually get a PDF that is ready for this commercial printing, please see the "PDF Options" under the Publish Tab.

## Limitations of Bloom’s current comic book support

-   Epub readers will not show comics correctly. These comics are intended for publishing on the web, Bloom Reader, and Reading App Builder.
-   If you change the paper-size or layout of a book, bubbles will get messed up and you’ll have to fix them.
-   The text in bubbles is currently limited to a rectangle, rather than conforming to the actual outlines of the bubble. You can use &lt;enter&gt; to manually break lines. Your comic will look more professional if you take the time to resize bubbles to be as tight as possible.
-   Comics are monolingual.
    - You cannot make comic books that show multiple languages on an image at the same time.
    - Even if a comic book contains multiple languages (as sources), users cannot switch between languages in Bloom Reader, the web, etc.
-   Only one version of bubble size and placement is stored in a book. Yet each time a comic is used for a different language, bubble sizes and locations will need to be adjusted. So if you if you get bubbles just right for, e.g., English, then go work on Spanish and then switch back to English, the bubble sizes and locations will again have to be adjusted.


## Tips on using the Comic Toolbox

-   When the comic tool is open and you have already selected an image, Bloom hides the normal picture-changing buttons so that they don’t get in the way of working with bubbles. If you need to change the image, first close the Toolbox so that these buttons become available again.
-   To move a bubble, click on the hand icon, or CTRL-drag anywhere in the bubble.
-   To resize a bubble, move your mouse cursor to the little resize icon, or ALT-drag anywhere in the bubble.
-   In the rare case that you need to change the curve of a bubble tail, drag the circle that is in the middle of the tail. It will become a solid color to indicate that you have left “auto mode”. To return to “auto mode”, double click that circle.

## Tips on “lettering”

_“Lettering”_ is the term used for adding bubbles and text to comics. Take some time to learn what professional _letterers_ say about making a good looking comics. Bloom takes care of some of these things for you, but there are many things that require training your eye. See https://blambot.com/pages/lettering-tips. Note, you do _not_ need to only use upper case letters. It does look cool because we are used to seeing comics done this way, but you should do whatever is best for your audience. If you do choose upper case _and_ have a script that is widely supported, consider using a special comic book font. See [here](https://blambot.com/collections/all-fonts/dialogue) and [here](https://jasonthibault.com/comic-book-fonts/).

## A note on White on Black Text

You can use "Change Layout" to divide the screen and add a text box on the size. The background will be black, so you'll need to select the style "WhiteText".
