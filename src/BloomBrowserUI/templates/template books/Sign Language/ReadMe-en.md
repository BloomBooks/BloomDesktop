The **Sign Language** template is a collection of pages that can hold a video in addition to text and pictures.

Here are two primary ways to get pages that can hold videos into a book:

* Use this template to create an *original* book, and then add pages that can hold videos as needed.
* Modify an *existing* book or shell book so it has pages that can hold videos. In this case, here are the general steps:
    1. Open the book in the **Edit** tab.
    2. Click the lock icon that is near the bottom of the **Pages** pane to unlock the book.
    3. Click a page and then right click that page, and then click **Choose Different Layout**.
    4. Click the appropriate layout that appears under **Sign Language**.
    5. Select the **Change all similar pages...** check box.
    6. Click the button **USE THIS LAYOUT**.
