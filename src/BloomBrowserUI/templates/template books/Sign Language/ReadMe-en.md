The **Sign Language** template is a collection of pages that have a video frame as well as (or instead of) the usual pictures and text.

There are two primary ways to get sign language pages into your book.

 1. Use this template to create a book from scratch and add more pages from this template as needed, or
 2. Modify an existing shell book so that its pages include a frame for a video.

If you are using method #2 (modifying a shell book), here are the easiest steps:

 1. Open the book and unlock it by clicking on the lock icon in the lower left corner.
 2. Select a page and right click on it. Click on *Choose Different Layout*.
 3. Choose an appropriate page listed under **Sign Language**.
 4. Tick the checkbox that says *Change all similar pages...*
 5. Click the button USE THIS LAYOUT.
