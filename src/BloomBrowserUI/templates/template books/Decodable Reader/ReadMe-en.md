A **Decodable Reader** is a book that carefully limits the letters and words used so that it fits what a new reader is ready to read. Typically a language may have 5 - 10 *decodable stages* through which learners progress. {i18n="decodable.definition"}

Bloom helps you to define this sequence of *stages* that readers work through. Each book you create will be targeted at one of those stages, and Bloom helps you to make sure that your book is *decodable* (figure out-able) by learners at that *stage*. {i18n="decodable.stages"}

You can also make a Bloom Pack of *templates* that others can use to quickly create books based on the levels and stages that have been prepared by a literacy specialist. {i18n="decodable.templates"}
