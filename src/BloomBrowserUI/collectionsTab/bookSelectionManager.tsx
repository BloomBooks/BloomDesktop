// This class supports the useIsSelected function (below), which is useful when many components
// (e.g., BookButtons) want to re-render when they change between being the selected book and
// not being the selected book, but we don't want them all to re-render when the selected book
// changes (since most of them remain unselected and there is no significant change). The idea is
// that at a high level one instance of BookSelectionManager is created, and passed down (possibly
// through a context) to the things that need to know whether a particular ID is selected.
// The one BookSelectionManager monitors the websocket message that tells us the selected book
// has changed.
// Through useIsSelected the leaf objects then have a boolean state which changes (causing a render)
// only when that particular book switches between being selected and not being selected.
