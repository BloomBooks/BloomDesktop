## Bloom cannot find some of its own files, and cannot continue {i18n="integrity.title"}

### Possible Causes {i18n="integrity.causes"}

1) Your antivirus may have "quarantined" one or more Bloom files. {i18n="integrity.causes.1"}

2) Your computer administrator may have your computer "locked down" to prevent bad things, but in such a way that Bloom could not place these files where they belong.  {i18n="integrity.causes.2"}

### What To Do {i18n="integrity.todo"}

After you submit this report, we will contact you and help you work this out. In the meantime, here are some ideas: {i18n="integrity.todo.ideas"}


* Run the Bloom installer again, and see if it starts up OK this time. {i18n="integrity.todo.ideas.Reinstall"}

* If that doesn't fix it, it's time to talk to your anti-virus program. If the "Missing Files" section below shows any files which end in ".exe",  consider "whitelisting" the Bloom program folder, which is at **{{installFolder}}**. {i18n="integrity.todo.ideas.Antivirus"}
    * AVAST: [Instructions](http://www.getavast.net/support/managing-exceptions). {i18n="integrity.todo.ideas.AVAST"}
    * Norton Antivirus: [Instructions from Symantec](https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.HOWTO80920.html). {i18n="integrity.todo.ideas.Norton"}
    * AVG: [Instructions from AVG](https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l=en_US&urlname=How-to-exclude-file-folder-or-website-from-AVG-scanning). {i18n="integrity.todo.ideas.AVG"}
    * Others: Google for "whitelist directory name-of-your-antivirus" {i18n="integrity.todo.ideas.Others"}

    * Run the Bloom installer again, and see if it starts up OK this time. {i18n="integrity.todo.ideas.Restart"}

* You can also try and retrieve the part of Bloom that your anti-virus program took from it. For AVG, you need to find the AVG "options" menu, click "virus vault", click on the Bloom file in the vault, and click "restore".
