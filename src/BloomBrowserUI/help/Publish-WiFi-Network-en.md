Many mobile phones have a feature called a 'hotspot' that creates a Wi-Fi network. First disconnect from the mobile network (so that there are no data charges). Next, enable the hotspot. Finally, set your laptop and other phones to join that network.

Windows 10 laptops can also create local Wi-Fi networks. Do a web search for "windows netsh hostednetwork". If your laptop does not support this, you can get inexpensive USB Wi-Fi adaptors that do. When shopping, make sure the adaptor supports "hosted network".
