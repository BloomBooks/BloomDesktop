/*  Some books may need control over aspects of layout that cannot yet be adjusted
	from the Bloom interface. In those cases, Bloom provides this "under the hood" method
	of creating style rules using the underlying "Cascading Stylesheets" system.
	These rules are then applied to all books in this collection.

	You can learn about CSS from hundreds of books, or online. However chances are, if
	you need this customization, you need an expert to create a version of this file for you.

	What follows are just some examples to help people who are already familiar
	with web development (html & css):

Example: You are making a bilingual book and need the English to be in a different font:

*[lang="en"]
{
	font-family:"Times New Roman";
}

You can also set other CSS properties, like line-height. The following says "Any thai text should be single spaced".

*[lang="th"]
{
	line-height: 1 !important;
}

Note: you can also add a file named "customBookStyles.css" in the book folder, to limit the effects of the rules to just that one book.

Note: Bloom/web browsers will ignore everything inside these star-slash markers, so the real content starts below:

BODY
{
}
