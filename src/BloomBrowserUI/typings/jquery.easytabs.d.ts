// Informs typescript that jquery.easytabs extends JQuery with function easytabs
interface JQuery {
        easytabs(options: any): JQuery;
        // enhance: this belongs in its own d.ts file, but I can't find the component that makes this extension to JQuery.
        sort(compare: (a: HTMLElement, b: HTMLElement)=>number): JQuery;
}
