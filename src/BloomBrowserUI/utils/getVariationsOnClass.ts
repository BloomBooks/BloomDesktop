// Looking at all the CSS rules in the document, this function finds the
// ones where a selector looks for a class that starts with a given prefix.
// It finds the unique continuations of that prefix.
// For example, if it is passed "game-theme-", it will find rules with
// selectors like ".game-theme-red", ".game-theme-blue", and ".game-theme-green"
// and produce ["blue", "green", "red"].
// The results are passed to the handleResults function.
// If the document is not yet completely loaded, it will attach a one-time event
// handler and call handleResults again after the document is ready.
