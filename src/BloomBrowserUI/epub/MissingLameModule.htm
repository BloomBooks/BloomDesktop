          Your book has audio recordings. Bloom can use these to make a talking book. To do this, you must first install \"Lame For Audacity\", if it is legal in your country. This is used to create the compressed recordings
          required for talking books. Google \"Lame For Audacity\" to get an up-to-date link.
      </p>
      <p>If you prefer to go ahead and publish your book without audio, click <a id="proceedWithoutAudio" href="javascript:void(0)">here</a>.</p>
