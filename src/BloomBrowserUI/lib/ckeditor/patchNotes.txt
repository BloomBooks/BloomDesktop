This file is to note changes we made to the generated ckeditor.js file which we think was generated
by the online configuration tool for CkEditor 4.5.1.

There may have been changes before the ones noted here.

October 2025: Removed the call to autoInline, which (unless an option disableAutoInline was set) automatically
attached CkEditor to every editable div on the page. I did this as part of the switch to vite, because
I could not find any way to set that option before the autoInlining got done. This is because CkEditor
is loaded as text/javascript, while our own code is loaded as a module, so any immediate execute code
of ours (but not of CkEditors) is delayed until the DOM is loaded. This version of CkEditor simply never
autoInlines.
