// A separate .less file seems to be the only way apply styles to a Material-ui 'input' element directly.
// The Textfield api has an InputProps, but this applies a layer up where it does no good in this case.
// We used to have other css in here too, but it made the SmallNumberPicker useless
// in other contexts. So now the css is in the container where it belongs.

.smallNumberPicker {
    input {
        text-align: right;
    }
}
