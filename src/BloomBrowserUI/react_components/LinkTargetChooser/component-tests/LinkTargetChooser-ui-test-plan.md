# LinkTargetChooser UI Test Plan

## Setup Phase - Minimal Testing

This is the initial test plan to verify the testing infrastructure works.

### Phase 1: URLEditor Basic Functionality

- [x] URLEditor component renders in browser
- [ ] Can type a URL into the text field
- [ ] URL value is displayed correctly
- [ ] Paste button is visible
- [ ] Open button is visible and disabled when URL is empty
- [ ] Open button is enabled when URL has a value

### Future Phases (Not Yet)

Once the setup phase is complete, we'll expand testing to include:
- Book selection functionality
- Page selection functionality
- Mutual exclusivity between URL and book/page selection
- Dialog OK button state
- Full integration tests
