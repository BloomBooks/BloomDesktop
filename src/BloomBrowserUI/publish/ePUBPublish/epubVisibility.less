// Items hidden only in epubs are defined here.
// One might think they should be defined in baseEPUB.less.
// But baseEPUB.less is actually shipped with epubs whereas basePage.less is used at the
// time the epub is created to determine what elements should be shown and hidden.
// Hidden elements will actually be removed from the dom
// completely since some eReaders don't handle display:none properly.
// The epub-visibility class and this stylesheet are added in EpubMaker.RemoveUnwantedContent()
// and are *only* used to strip out elements we don't want included in our epub dom.
// Not sure why we now need "!important" on these, when we apparently didn't before. (BL-9844)
