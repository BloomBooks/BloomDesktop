// This stylesheet is a minimal set designed to make our epubs look as much as possible like the printed books,
// while not locking down things that depend on a specific page size.
// The remaining rules are things that wound up slightly different from the printed book rules
// for reasons which I mostly don't remember; unfortunately, the experiments leading to the
// final epub PR were spread out over a long period.

// IMPORTANT: do not set anything here to display:none.
// Some/many eReaders do not properly handle display:none which means the content
// will be displayed in error. To hide content for epubs only, use epubVisibility.less
// which is used at epub creation time to remove content from the dom completely.
