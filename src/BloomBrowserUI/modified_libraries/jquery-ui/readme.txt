jquery-ui is a weird one in the current npm/bower world. 
First, its website actively encouraged downloading one of these "customized" versions, which is incompatible with the npm/bower approach.
Second, someone made an npm version of it (https://github.com/devongovett/jqueryui-npm), but only up to 1.10.3, whereas jquery-ui continued on, adding explicit module support in 1.11.
For now, we're going to stick with our custom version that lives in here.
