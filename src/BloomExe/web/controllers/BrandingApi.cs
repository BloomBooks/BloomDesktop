	/// to point to the svg or png file which we copy into the book folder.
	/// This process (in XMatterHelper.CleanupBrandingImages()) allows the books to look right when
	/// opened in a browser and also in BloomReader. (It would also help with making Epubs, though that
	/// code is already written to handle branding.)
	/// Keeping this class active (a) because most of its logic is used by CleanupBrandingImages(),
	/// and (b) as a safety net, in case there's some way an api/branding url still gets presented
	/// to the image server.
