		// find the folder where the repo lives, or it's a dropbox folder but
		// Dropbox is not running or we can't ping dropbox.com.
		// A collection we know is a TC may also be disabled because there is no

		// operations because the user has not registered; I've been calling this
		// disabled also, but it's not just that we choose not to allow it; we
		// actually need the missing information to make things work.
		// In all these situations, most TC operations simply don't happen because

		// This property allows us to find the TC whether or not it is disconnected.
