    // General base class for three kinds of repo changes detected in event handlers.
    // This class doesn't have any interesting properties, but it allows us to declare
    // a list of RepoChangeEventArgs which can hold one of these (currently used for
    // changes at the collection settings level), or its subclasses
    // BookRepoChangeEventArgs, or NewBookEventArgs, and tell which of the three
    // kinds of events it represents. (We could instead use some enumeration of
    // possible types of Repo changes, but two of them need a book name while the
    // third does not, so on the whole I think the three classes works best.)
