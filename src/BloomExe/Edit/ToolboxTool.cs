	/// page when the user expands it. There is a subclass for each tool.
	/// These objects are serialized as part of the meta.json file representing the state of a book.
	/// The State field is persisted in this way; it is also passed in to the JavaScript that manages
	/// the toolbox. New fields and properties should be kept non-public or marked with an
	/// appropriate attribute if they should NOT be persisted in JSON.
	/// New subclasses will typically require a new case in CreateFromJsonToolId and also in ToolboxToolConverter.ReadJson.
	/// Note that the values of the Name field are used in the json and therefore cannot readily be changed.
	/// (Migration would handle a change going forward, but older Blooms would lose the data at best.)
