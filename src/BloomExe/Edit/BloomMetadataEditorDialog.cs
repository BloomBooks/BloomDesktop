			// The spec for BL-11207 says we can reduce the copyright holder field to one line, but this

			// the Libpalaso code uses the Left of this control to align the Left of the LicenseRights
			// control when the CC image is hidden (i.e., when it contains Custom rights rather than
			// Additional Requests). So, instead, we make it wider by twice that amount.
			// Centering of the image puts it where we want.

			// But we can't just make the panel narrower; bad things happen if it needs to wrap the heading
			// onto a second line. Nor does Windows.Forms support giving it a transparent background.
			// So the only way to allow its first child to be wide and the picture to be seen below that
			// and right of the radio buttons is to move the heading out of the panel, adjust the positions
			// of the panel children, and make the panel less wide so it doesn't cover the picture.
			// (We can't just promote ALL the children and get rid of the panel, because the behavior
			// of the radio buttons is somehow tied to being grouped in this panel.)
