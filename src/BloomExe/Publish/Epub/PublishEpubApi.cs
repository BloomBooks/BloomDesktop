		// Normally, every Bloom API request is isolated by a lock from every other. That is, there can't be
		// two api requests from JS land manipulating the DOM (or anything else) at the same time and causing
		// race conditions. So we don't need to worry about locks to guard against different server threads
		// entering this class at the same time.
		// That won't work for aborting an epub generation that is in progress, because the API call to do the
		// abort can't get the lock that is already held by the thread making the obsolete preview.
		// So, that handler is NOT locked relative to all other API calls, including the other ones in this class.
		// Also, it's annoying if the Save button doesn't respond until the preview is complete; so, since that
		// only accesses a couple of private variables in this class, we allow that one to run without
		// the lock and collect the destination file.
		// We want to hold a lock just enough to make sure there are no race conditions involving changes to
		// whether EpubMaker is null, whether we are staging it, and whether its abort flag has been set.
		// That's not a problem for the abort thread, which holds no other lock.
		// But what about the thread that holds the global API lock and is making the preview? If it seeks
		// the EpubMaker lock, we need to be sure that no other thread will ever claim the epubmaker lock
		// and then seek the global API lock. That's OK, because the only things that seek the EpubMaker lock
		// either already have the API lock or never seek it (i.e., this two unlocked handlers).
		// Make sure to only claim this lock in a thread that already holds the API lock or never seeks it.
		// We also need to be careful about this lock and the UI thread. We can't have something holding this
		// lock and waiting for the UI thread, while the UI thread is waiting for the lock. The convention for
		// ensuring this is that, except for the Save action which runs ON the UI thread, nothing that holds
