		//About the --zoom parameter. It's a hack to get the pages chopped properly.
		//Notes: Remember, a page border *will make the page that much larger!*
		//		One way to see what's happening without a page border is to make the marginBox visible,
		//		then scroll through and you can see it moving up (if the page (zoom factor) is too small) or down (if page (zoom factor) is too large)
		//		Until Aug 2012, I had 1.091. But with large a4 landscape docs (e.g. calendar), I saw
		//		that the page was too big, leading to an extra page at the end.
		//		Experimentation showed that 1.041 kept the marge box steady.
		//
		//	In July 2013, I needed to get a 200-300 page b5 book out. With the prior 96DPI setting of 1.041, it was drifting upwards (too small). Upping it to 1.042 solved it.
