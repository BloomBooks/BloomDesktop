A **Leveled Reader** is a book that is written specifically for a learner who is at a certain level of reading development. Levels define targets for word length, sentence length, etc. They also determine appropriate formatting, vocabulary, illustration support, and topic. {i18n="leveled.definition"}

After you have defined a sequence of *levels*, you can assign a level to books you create either with this template or the "Decodable Reader Template". As you type into the book, Bloom will help you keep the level in mind and point out when you exceed the limits of the level. {i18n="leveled.levels"}

You can also make a Bloom Pack of *templates* that others can use to quickly create books based on the levels and stages that have been prepared by a literacy specialist. {i18n="leveled.templates"}

To learn about using Leveled Readers in Bloom, you can: {i18n="leveled.learn"}

- Watch [these instructional videos](http://tiny.cc/8vbwux).{i18n="leveled.learn.videos"}
- Go to the Help menu, choose 'Documentation', and look in the index under "Leveled Readers".{i18n="leveled.learn.helpindex"}
- Go to the Help menu and choose: "Building Reader Templates".{i18n="leveled.learn.helpmenu"}

### Relationship to Decodable Readers {i18n="leveled.vs.decodable"}

So how do leveled reader *levels* fit in decodable reader *stages*? The two concepts are complementary, and Bloom allows you to set both a *decodable stage* and a *leveled reader level* for a book you are writing. Typically books at level 1 and possibly level 2 will also need to be written with *decodability stages* in mind. Books at the first level or two will also need to be careful about being *decodable* (i.e. using letters the reader has learned). So a sequence of books might look like this: {i18n="leveled.and.decodable"}

<table>
  <tr style="font-weight:bold">
    <td style="width:10em" i18n="leveled.reader.level">Leveled Reader Level</td>
    <td i18n="decodable.stage">Decodable Stage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>    <td>1</td>    <td>1</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>1</td>    <td>2</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>1</td>    <td>3</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>1</td>    <td>4</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>1</td>    <td>5</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>1</td>    <td>6</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>2</td>    <td>n/a</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>3</td>    <td>n/a</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>4</td>    <td>n/a</td>  </tr>
    <tr>    <td>5</td>    <td>n/a</td>  </tr>
