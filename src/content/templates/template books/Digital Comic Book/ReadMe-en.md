Note: The Overlay Tool requires that you have <a href="" onclick="fetch('/bloom/api/common/showSettingsDialog?tab=enterprise', {method:'POST'})">Bloom Enterprise</a> enabled. However, you can localize a shellbook that contain overlay elements into your own language without enabling Bloom Enterprise.

Use this template as a starting point for comics designed for use on screens.

## Limitations of Bloom’s current comic book support

-   As with other text, Bloom's Talking Book Tool allows recording audio for comic bubbles. The checkbox "Show Playback Order buttons" in the Talking Book Tool enables you to define the playback order of the bubbles.
-   If you change the paper-size or layout of a book, you may have to adjust the locations of bubbles.
-   The text in bubbles is currently limited to a rectangle, rather than conforming to the actual outlines of the bubble. You can use &lt;enter&gt; to manually break lines. Your comic will look more professional if you take the time to resize bubbles to be as tight as possible.
-   Comic books can show only one language on an image at the same time.
-   If a comic book contains multiple languages (as sources), users can switch between languages in Bloom Reader, the web, etc.

## Tips on adapting existing comic images to Bloom device format

Unless the original image is already 16x9 in proportion, you have several choices:

1. Crop a portion of it to 16x9.
1. Leave it in its original proportion and let Bloom fill in black around the edges that appear when it is shrunk to fit 16x9.
1. Crop it to something else and let Bloom fill in black around the edges that appear when it is shrunk to fit 16x9.
1. Create a 16x9 rectangle in your graphics program and place the image within it. This allows you to place all the padding on one side or the other, rather than leaving it to Bloom to center the image. This can be useful for creating enough space for a caption.

## Tips on using the Overlay Toolbox

-   When the Overlay tool is open and you have already selected an image, Bloom hides the normal picture-changing buttons so that they don’t get in the way of working with bubbles. If you need to change the image, first close the Toolbox so that these buttons become available again.
-   To move a bubble, click on the hand icon, or CTRL-drag anywhere in the bubble.
-   To resize a bubble, move your mouse cursor to the little resize icon, or ALT-drag anywhere in the bubble.
-   In the rare case that you need to change the curve of a bubble tail, drag the circle that is in the middle of the tail. It will become a solid color to indicate that you have left “auto mode”. To return to “auto mode”, double click that circle.

## Tips on “lettering”

_“Lettering”_ is the term used for adding bubbles and text to comics. Take some time to learn what professional _letterers_ say about making a good looking comics. Bloom takes care of some of these things for you, but there are many things that require training your eye. See https://blambot.com/pages/lettering-tips. Note, you do _not_ need to only use upper case letters. It does look cool because we are used to seeing comics done this way, but you should do whatever is best for your audience. If you do choose upper case _and_ have a script that is widely supported, consider using a special comic book font. See [here](https://blambot.com/collections/all-fonts/dialogue) and [here](https://jasonthibault.com/comic-book-fonts/).

## A note on White on Black Text

You can use "Change Layout" to divide the screen and add a text box on the side. The background will be black, so you'll need to select the style "WhiteText".
