# About the Sign Language Template

This template provides a collection of pages that can hold a video in addition to text and pictures.

Using the Sign Language tool, you can record a video of a person Signing the message to be communicated for each page using the Sign Language of your choice, or you can import a pre-recorded sign language video.

A growing number of Sign Language communities from across the globe are choosing to publish their Sign Language books on Bloom Library. To view these books, check out [this page](https://bloomlibrary.org/sign-language).
