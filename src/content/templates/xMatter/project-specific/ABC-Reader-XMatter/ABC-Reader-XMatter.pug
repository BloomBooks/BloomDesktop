//- We would like to put most of the blocks and mixins from ABC-Reader-XMatter.pug in here,
//- but we are limited by the fact that we can't 'include' definitions for other mixins from another file.
//- If we try to (e.g.) include bloom-foundation-mixins.pug so we can use +editable, etc., we get a message
//- about "Only named blocks and mixins can appear at the top level of an extending template".
//- Therefore this file only contains all common mixins and blocks that don't reference mixins defined elsewhere.
//- The rest are in ABC-Reader-XMatter.pug.
