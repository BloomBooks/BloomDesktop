At the time of creation, this is the same as "Word-Vision-International". It's only separate so that the codes are less confusing.
The codes we're using for this are, e.g. "WorldVision(Ethiopia)", "WorldVision(Burundi)", etc. Bloom removes the "subunit" name in parenthesis and then lands here, on "WorldVision".
