/* This is the default theme, not only in the sense that it is the one we use by default for new books,
 * but also in the sense that it is copied to the start of each appearance.css file. Thus, the values
 * set in this initial .bloom-page block are defaults for EVERY page in EVERY book, and this block is
 * intended to provide a default for EVERY variable controlled by the appearance system.
 * Some of these values are overridden for certain page sizes by other rules in this file.
 * Intentionally, those rules are not more specific than this one, they just come later in the file
 * and win for that reason.
 * The rules for any other theme are copied later than the ones from this file in appearance.css,
 * so anything in those files with the same (or of course greater) specificity can override these.
 * For example, page-margin-right is set to 12mm in a .bloom-page block early in this file.
 * For an A4Landscape page, a later rule in this file overrides the .bloom-page rule and makes it 15mm.
 * If the book uses the large margins theme, a .bloom-page rule in that file overrides it again to 25mm.
 * The rounded border theme overrides it to 2.5mm for Device page sizes, using a differerent selector again.
 * These rules all have the same specificity even though they have different selectors, so the last one wins.
 * I don't much like depending on the order of rules like this, or having rules left in the
 * generated appearance.css file that we know will never apply to anything. But I don't see a better way
 * to get the desired results:
 * - a default for every property here that applies to every page in every book in every theme
 * - a way to override default property values for certain page sizes
 * - a way to override for certain themes (either for all page sizes or by page-size)
