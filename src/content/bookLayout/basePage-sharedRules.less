// As of 5.5, Bloom can have style-based rules in the HTML file giving properties
// for highlighting active audio, and these use the ui-audioCurrent class that
// Bloom applies in the talking-book tool. Accordingly, we tell the agent to
// apply that class. However, the user may NOT have configured a custom highlighting.
// In case they do not, this provides the default highlighting. In this location,
// it works for edit mode, bloomPubs, both kinds of ePUBs, and very likely anywhere
// else we'd want ui-audioCurrent to produce a highlight.
// Setting the foreground color is usually redundant, but digital comic book covers
// use white text, and it's now possible for the user to choose a text color, so
// we want to ensure a contrast with the background color (unless the user overrides,
// in which case, adequate contrast is up to them).
// (Color is @bloom-yellow.)
// (When editing the text, this background causes problems (due to a Chromium bug)
// if the elements have their default position: relative. This is overidden in
// audioRecording.less.)
