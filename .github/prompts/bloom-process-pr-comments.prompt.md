description: read and process comments in a pr
---

Use the gh tool to determine the PR associated with the current branch. If you cannot find one, use the askQuestions tool to ask the user for a url.
Read the unresolved pr comments and either answer them or handle the problem they call out and then answer them.
When you answer, prefix your response with the name of your model, e.g. [hall9000].
