## Bloom Notes & License

### Automatic Update

Bloom automatically checks for new versions and downloads them while you work. You can disable this feature in the Settings area.

### Automated Feedback

Statistics about use of Bloom are sent to the developers via the internet.
This is done to help us know where our free products are being used, and which features people are finding most useful.
This is critically important to setting our priorities for future work. If you need to disable this feature, please contact us.
