<p>(these notes were last updated for version 0.1.57.&#160; Because we release so frequently (even daily), we may at times fall behind updating it.)</p>

<h3>Known Problems</h3>

<p>After extracting audio from a video file, the audio file does not appear in the file list. Work around: switch to another session, then back. [<a href="http://jira.palaso.org/issues/browse/SP-99">SP-99</a>]</p>

<p>Changing the spelling of a custom-field name does not propagate the change to other files using the same custom-field. [<a href="http://jira.palaso.org/issues/browse/SP-100">SP-100</a>]</p>

<p>In the “New Files From Device” dialog, if you click "Create Sessions" while the preview player is still running, it “locks” the file and SayMore cannot then copy it into a session. [<a href="http://jira.palaso.org/issues/browse/SP-98">SP-98</a>]</p>

<h3>Known Limitations</h3>

<p>The Export to CSS command is only partially implemented.</p>

<p>There is no way&#160; yet customize the file naming conventions.</p>

<p>There is no good way yet to track who all the contributors were to various session components (e.g., who did the transcribing). Until this is done, its possible to make do by using with custom fields.</p>

<p>While type-ahead works&#160; on many fields, it does not yet work for entering multiple participant names.</p>

<p>You must currently use right-clicking on files to do things with them; this will soon be possible from the main-menu bar.</p>

<p>When using the “Add” button, you can only choose one file at a time.</p>
