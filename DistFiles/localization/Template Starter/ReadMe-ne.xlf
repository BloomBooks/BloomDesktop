        <source xml:lang="en">This special template lets you make your own templates. A template provides a set of related page layouts that an author can choose from in writing an original book. Usually the text blocks and picture blocks on template pages will be empty, ready for an author to fill in. Sometimes there may be standard text or pictures that should be on every copy of the page.
There are two ways people can use your template. The first way is to start new books. For example, imagine student books that have one page for each school day of the week. You could make a template with 5 pages, each with places to type in text and choose pictures. Curriculum authors could select your template and make a new book, one for each week<g id="genid-1" ctype="x-html-sup"><g id="genid-2" ctype="x-html-a" html:href="#note1">1</g></g>.</source>
