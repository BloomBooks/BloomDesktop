I downloaded the other text files in this directory from

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/fonts/main/ofl/abeezee/

and the ABeeZee-Regular.ttf ABeeZee-Italic.ttf files from

https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/abeezee/ABeeZee-Regular.ttf and
https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/abeezee/ABeeZee-Italic.ttf

I then followed the instructions found at

https://henry.codes/writing/how-to-convert-variable-ttf-font-files-to-woff2/

to convert the .ttf files to .woff2 files.  This involved cloning google's git
repository for a woff2 converter by

git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/woff2.git

and then building the code and running the converter on the two .ttf files.  (I
had the advantage of having a Linux system to build with.  Windows users may be
able to use a build system based on Cygwin (or MinGW) similarly to how we've
worked on ffmpeg and other programs.)

An alternative may be to use the font downloader at

https://www.axllent.org/code/google-font-downloader/#disqus_thread

which produces a zip file containing the fonts in a variety of formats.  But
why trust a random website when you can use google's github repositories?
