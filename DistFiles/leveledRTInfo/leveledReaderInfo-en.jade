		h1(id='Vocabulary') Vocabulary
		p At beginning levels, use simple words that are familiar to children. If it is possible in your language, use words with only one syllable. As children move up to higher levels, you can begin to use words with more syllables. You can begin to use less familiar words. Children should be able to guess the meaning of these less familiar words from the context of the surrounding words and sentences, as well as from the illustrations.
		h1(id='Formatting') Formatting
		p Beginner readers will benefit from a larger font with clear spacing between words. Having the words or sentences in the same location on each page is also helpful. As readers progress to higher levels, font size and spacing will decrease and sentences can appear in different locations on the page.
		p To increase the font size, line-spacing, and word-spacing in Bloom, click in a text box and then on the grey "cog" icon in the lower left-hand corner. If you do this and then make a template book, books made with that template will also use those font settings.
		h1(id='Predictability') Predictability
		p
			em Predictability
			|  in a text means that the reader can guess what would come next. You can increase predictability by using repeated patterns. Here are some patterns you can use:
		ul
			li Repetition - repeating parts of the text, for example, using the same sentence with each page and just changing one word in the sentence
			li Sequencing - a story with a known sequence such as the days of the week or that uses numbers in a pattern
			li Building Sequence - a story with a pattern that is repeated and added to with each new page
			li Rhyme - a story with a pattern or sequence that also includes rhyme. For example:

		h1(id='IllustrationSupport') Illustration Support
		p Illustrations provide support to the story. Illustrations relate to the story in different ways at different

				|  the pictures should offer some support to the story line. As the amount of text increases, the reader is less reliant on the pictures and gets more meaning from the text. The illustrations can be more complex.
			li For

				|  the pictures should offer little or no support to the story line. The reader relies more on the text than the pictures for meaning. The illustrations can be even more complex.
		h1(id='ChoiceOfTopic') Choice of Topic
		p Books can be on many topics. When developing books for beginning readers, choose topics that are familiar to them. Readers will be eager to read and will read more if they are reading about things they find interesting and familiar. For more experienced readers, topics can include information that the reader is not already familiar with.

				|  the book should be concrete, should focus on one idea/theme, and should be familiar and easy to understand.

				| , develop a story around a familiar concept but in greater depth.
			li For
				= ' '
				strong Fluent Readers
				|  the concepts can expand beyond what is familiar, be more varied, and be abstract.
