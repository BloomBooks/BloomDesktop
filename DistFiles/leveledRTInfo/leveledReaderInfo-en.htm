    <h1 id="Predictability">Predictability</h1>
    <p>Predictability in a text means that a text has repetition of specific language, the context is familiar to the reader, pictures are supportive to the text, language patterns are common to readers, often there is rhyme, and the reader can guess/predict what would come next in the storyline.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>When choosing illustrations to go with your story, choose pictures that closely match your story line. The reader should be able to predict the story line just by looking at the picture.</li>

        <h3 id="ConceptLoad">Concept load (Topic familiarity)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When developing a book choose topics that are familiar to the readers. Readers will be eager to read and will read more if they are reading about things they are interested in and familiar with.</li>
          <li>For <strong>Emergent Readers</strong> the text and concepts should be highly supported by pictures. Concepts should be concrete, should focus on one idea/theme and should be easy to understand.
          </li>
          <li>For <strong>Early Readers</strong> develop a story around one familiar concept with less support by pictures. As readers become more fluent, develop a story around a familiar concept but in greater depth.
          </li>
          <li>For <strong>Fluent Readers</strong> the concepts are expand beyond what is familiar, are more varied and abstract.
          </li>
        </ul>
