##Bloom cannot find some of its own files, and cannot continue

###Possible Causes

1) Your antivirus may have "quarantined" one or more Bloom files.

2) Your computer administrator may have your computer "locked down" to prevent bad things, but in such a way that Bloom could not place these files where they belong. 

###What To Do

After you submit this report, we will contact you and help you work this out. In the meantime, here are some ideas:

* Run the Bloom installer again, and see if it starts up OK this time.

* If the "Missing Files" section below shows any files which end in ".exe",  consider "whitelisting" the Bloom program folder, which is at **{installFolder}**.
    * AVAST: [Instructions](http://www.getavast.net/support/managing-exceptions).
    * Norton Antivirus: [Instructions from Symantec](https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.HOWTO80920.html).
    * AVG: [Instructions from AVG](https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l=en_US&urlname=How-to-exclude-file-folder-or-website-from-AVG-scanning).
