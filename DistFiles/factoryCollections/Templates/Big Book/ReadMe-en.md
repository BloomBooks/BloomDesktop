# About Big Books
Big Books are designed for teachers to hold and read in front of a class. For more information, see this [PDF from Scholastic](http://www.scholastic.ca/bigbooks/AGuidetoUsingBigBooksintheClassroom.pdf).
# Printing a Big Book
To make things more manageable, this template is set at A4 Landscape, with large fonts.
You can easily produce books that are A3 (twice as large).
Just take your A4 PDF to a printer and ask them to enlarge it to A3.
# Limitations of this version
If you are using a small screen, it can be hard to read the credits page. Try using CTRL+mouse wheel to zoom in to the page so you can edit it.

This version includes an "Instructions for Teachers" page that is already filled out, in English.
If you would like to have instructions in a different language, you can delete that text and type in your own.
If you send us that text, we can include it in a future version of the template.
