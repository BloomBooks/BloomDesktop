/*Use this Cascading Stylesheet File to customize the font & base size used in books in this collection.

You can learn about CSS from hundreds of books, or online, but the following may be enough.

Otherwise, feel free to post your needs on the Bloom mailing list and someone will happily make you a custom collection.css file.

Example: The following would set us up for a collection based on Thai-based language; this font is quite small, so we will also increase the base size from 10 point to 16 point:

BODY
{
	font-family:"Angsana New";
	font-size:16pt;
}

Note, that is a blunt instrument. It will apply to all the text, regardless of the langauge. That should be OK in many cases.

If you ned to set the font for a particular language, do it like this:

*[lang="en"]
{
	font-family:"Times New Roman";
}

Note: if you include the font-size declaration in the above rule, now *all* your English bits will be that size, which might not be what you want.

So --sorry this is getting complicated-- you would have to have a more specific rule, like

.coverTitle *[lang="en"]
{
	font-size: 20pt !important;
}

You can also set other CSS properties, like line-height. The following says "Any thai text should be single spaced".

*[lang="th"]
{
	line-height: 1 !important;
}

Note: you can also add a file named "customBookStyles.css" in the book folder, to limit the effects of the rules to just that one book.

Note: Bloom/web browsers will ignore everything inside these star-slash markers, so the real content starts below:

BODY
{
}
