    <h3>A minimal ghostscript is aggregated with Bloom.</h3>
    <p>A minimal copy of ghostscript (consisting only of the program itself) is distributed with
    the Windows Bloom program.  (The Linux Bloom program uses the system installation of
    ghostscript.)  If you would like the full distribution of the same version of ghostscript,
    it is available as
<a href="https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/download/gs921/gs921w32.exe">https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/download/gs921/gs921w32.exe</a>.
    The full source code for that version of ghostscript is available as
<a href="https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/download/gs921/ghostscript-9.21.tar.gz">https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/download/gs921/ghostscript-9.21.tar.gz</a>.
    Bloom runs the ghostscript program for a couple of PDF file manipulations, but is capable
    of working with a normal ghostscript installation or without any access to ghostscript at
    all.<p>
    <p>The minimal ghostscript distributed with Bloom is fully usable on its own to perform the
    kinds of tasks that Bloom does with it.  Reducing the sizes of PDF files and converting PDF
    files to CMYK color are two of the operations that can be done with the ghostscript
    distributed with Bloom.</p>
    <p>The current version of ghostscript is available at
<a href="https://ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html">https://ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html</a>.</p>
