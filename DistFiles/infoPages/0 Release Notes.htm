Thanks for checking out this pre-release version of Bloom, which has been made available for experimentation and creation of shell books. It is not yet ready for wide-scale use.
</p>

<h4>0.3: 29 Nov 2011</h4>
---Breaking Changes---
Moved collections locations to c:\programdata\sil\bloom\collections.  Formerly, the sil part was missing. Bloom now creates this folder automatically.
Now avoiding the word "project", in favor of "library".  So now you "create a library for your language".  This change also shows up in configuration files, so if anyone has an existing *.BloomLibrary file, open it in a text editor and change all instances of "Project" to "Libary".

<h4>0.3: 25 Nov 2011</h4>
A5 Wall Calendar now usable, with vernacular days and months. Could use a graphic designer's love, though.

<h4>0.3: 24 Nov 2011</h4>
In the image toolbox, you can now reuse metadata (license, copyright, illustrator) from the last image you edited.

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This version has the following limitations (and probably many others). Feel free to suggest your priorities, especially if you're contributing to the Bloom project in some way :-)</p>
<li>The font is always Andika (if you have it). </li>
<li>All books are A5 size. </li>
<li>You can't control the cover color. </li>
<li>Diglots are not supported. </li>
<li>Right-To-Left languages are not supported (but I haven't seen what works and what doesn't)</li>
<li>If you have a pdf reader other than Adobe Acrobat set up to display PDFs in Firefox, that will also show up in the Publish tab of Bloom, and it might or might not work. PDF-XChange, for exmample, can make the screen quite complicated with toolbars, and doesn't auto-shrink to fit in the page.</li>
<li>You can't tweak the picture size, the text location, etc.</li>

<h2>Things that don't work yet</h2>
<li>When you open a page, the cursor should already be in the first editable box.</li>
<li>When you're just filling out a shell, you shouldn't be able to change the pictures.</li>
<li>There should be an obvious button for deleting books. Currently, you have to right-click to see a menu.</li>
<h2>Known problems</h2>
<li>Some things are a lot slower than they need to be.  These will be spead up in future versions.</li><li>
	Sometimes the thumbnails for books and pages aren&#39;t drawn correctly.&nbsp; Pages
	thumbnails will be recreated the next time you show the book, but book
	thumbnails are cached. So if you get a bad thumbnail, you currently have to
	delete the &quot;thumbnail.png&quot; that you&#39;ll find sitting in the book&#39;s file folder.<li>
		The Title Page and verso/copyright page are, well, they can
		only improve.
<h2>Reporting new problems</h2>
Please email problems to Bloom's issue tracking system at <a href="mailto:issues@bloom.palaso.org">issues@bloom.palaso.org</a>
<h2>Got Art Of Reading?</h2>
<p>Bloom doesn't install Art Of Reading, but it works very well with it.
	It is free, and now comes with embedded metadata,
