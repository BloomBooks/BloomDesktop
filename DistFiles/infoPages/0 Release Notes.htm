</ul>

<h4>What's New</h4>
<ul>

	<li>Bubbles only show when the field is empty, or in focus. This makes it easier to see what is left to be done.</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.5: Jan 27 2012</h3>
<h4>Format Changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The div which contains metadata used to be identified with class "-bloom-dataDiv". It is now identified by id, with id='bloomDataDiv'</li>

	<li>All stylesheet classes that used to start with "-bloom" now start with "bloom"</li>
</ul>

<h4>What's New</h4>
<ul>
	<li>You can now enter an ISBN #. This number is automatically removed when the book is used as a shell for a new book.</li>
	<li>Although jpegs should be rare in Bloom books (used only for photos), they are now left as jpegs, rather than being converted to PNGs. All other image formats are still converted to PNG.</li>
	<li>User can now make books bilingual or trilingual by ticking selecting one of the national languages.</li>
	<li>A Picture Dictionary template is now available, with resizable and draggable frames. The stylesheet adapts to monolingual, bilingual, or trilingual needs.</li>

 <h4>Known Problems</h4>
 <ul>
	<li>page thumbnails don't always update.</li>
	  <li>li translations bubble covers "book li in ___".</li>
	  <li>Adding images leaves an unneeded "_orginal" copy.</li>
	  <li>Custom license can't have single quotes (appostrophes)</li>
	  <li>Once a CreativeCommons license is chosen, changing to another option leaves us with the CC license Image.</li>

	</li>
 </ul>
<h3>0.4: Jan 2011</h3>

	<p>Style name change: coverBottomBookKind --&gt; coverBottomBookTopic</p>
	<p>Shells and templates may no longer include front or back matter pages.</p>
	<p>
		Introduced Factory-XMatter.htm and accompanying stylesheet.&nbsp; The contents
		of this are now inserted into each new book.&nbsp; These templates, which will
		be replaced by organizations/countries for their own needs, are populated by
		data from a combination of sources:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;Data from the library: language name, province, district, etc.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Data from the &quot;-bloomDataPage&quot; div of the shellbook itself. E.g.,
			acknowledgments, copyright, license.</li>
		<liData from the user. E.g. Translator name.</li>
	</ul>

			speech-bubble on the right</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>0.3: 9 Dec 2011</h4>

Format change: id attributes are no longer used in textareas or img's.
'hideme' class is no longer used to hide elements in languages other than those in the current publication. Instead, hiding is now the reponsibility of "languageDisplay.css", still based on the @lang attributes of elements.
	 evelopers can now right-click on pages and choose "View in System Browser". You can then have access to every bit of info you could want about the html, stylesheets, & scripts, using firefug (Firefox), or Chrome developer tools.

<h4>0.3: 1 Dec 2011</h4>
	<p>--Breaking Changes--<br />
		I&#39;ve abandoned the attempt to store Bloom files as xml html5.&nbsp;
		I risked death by a thousand paper cuts.&nbsp; So, as of this version, Bloom
		uses strictly-valid HTML5 (whether well-formed-xml or not).&nbsp; Internally,
		it&#39;s still doing xml; it uses HTML Tidy to convert to xml as needed.&nbsp; Other
		validation issues:</p>
	<p>The header material has changed so that it now passes the w3c validation for
		html5, with the only remaning complaint being the proprietary &lt;meta&gt; tags.</p>
	<p>&lt;meta&gt; tags now use @name attributes, instead of @id attributes.&nbsp; See the
		updated File Format help topic for updated information.</p>
	<h4>0.3: 30 Nov 2011</h4>
	---Breaking Changes-- <br />Making use of a new capabilty offered by html5, many formerly "special" classes have been moved to div-* attributes:
		<table>
		<thead><tr><th>old</th><th>new</th></tr></thead>
		<tr><td>class=&quot;-bloom-vernacularBookTitle&quot;</td><td>data-book="vernacularBookTitle"</td></tr>
		<tr><td>class="-bloom-topicInNationalLanguage"</td><td>data-book="topicInNationalLanguage"</td></tr>
		<tr><td>class="_myCustomVariable"</td><td>data-book="myCustomVariable"</td></tr>
		<tr><td>class="-bloom-nameOfLanguage"</td><td>data-library="nameOfLanguage"</td></tr>
		<tr><td>class="-bloom-singleton</td><td>data-page="singleton"</td></tr>
		<tr><td>class="-bloom-extraPage</td><td>data-page="extra"</td></tr>
		<tr><td>class="-bloom-required</td><td>data-page="required"</td></tr>
		</table>

<h4>0.3: 29 Nov 2011</h4>
	---Breaking Changes--- Moved collections locations to
	c:\programdata\sil\bloom\collections. Formerly, the sil part was missing. Bloom
	now creates this folder automatically. Now avoiding the word &quot;project&quot;, in favor
	of &quot;library&quot;. So now you &quot;create a library for your language&quot;. This change also
	shows up in configuration files, so if anyone has an existing *.BloomLibrary
	file, throw away the whole folder.

<h4>0.3: 25 Nov 2011</h4>
A5 Wall Calendar now usable, with vernacular days and months. Could use a graphic designer's love, though.

<h4>0.3: 24 Nov 2011</h4>
In the image toolbox, you can now reuse metadata (license, copyright, illustrator) from the last image you edited.

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This version has the following limitations (and probably many others). Feel free to suggest your priorities, especially if you're contributing to the Bloom project in some way :-)</p>
<li>The font is always Andika (if you have it). </li>
<li>All books are A5 size. </li>
<li>You can't control the cover color. </li>
<li>Diglots are not supported. </li>
<li>Right-To-Left languages are not supported (but I haven't seen what works and what doesn't)</li>
<li>If you have a pdf reader other than Adobe Acrobat set up to display PDFs in Firefox, that will also show up in the Publish tab of Bloom, and it might or might not work. PDF-XChange, for exmample, can make the screen quite complicated with toolbars, and doesn't auto-shrink to fit in the page.</li>
<li>You can't tweak the picture size, the text location, etc.</li>

<h2>Things that don't work yet</h2>
<li>When you open a page, the cursor should already be in the first editable box.</li>
<li>When you're just filling out a shell, you shouldn't be able to change the pictures.</li>
<li>There should be an obvious button for deleting books. Currently, you have to right-click to see a menu.</li>
<h2>Known problems</h2>
<li>Some things are a lot slower than they need to be.  These will be spead up in future versions.</li><li>
	Sometimes the thumbnails for books and pages aren&#39;t drawn correctly.&nbsp; Pages
	thumbnails will be recreated the next time you show the book, but book
	thumbnails are cached. So if you get a bad thumbnail, you currently have to
	delete the &quot;thumbnail.png&quot; that you&#39;ll find sitting in the book&#39;s file folder.<li>
		The Title Page and verso/copyright page are, well, they can
		only improve.
<h2>Reporting new problems</h2>
Please email problems to Bloom's issue tracking system at <a href="mailto:issues@bloom.palaso.org">issues@bloom.palaso.org</a>
<h2>Got Art Of Reading?</h2>
<p>Bloom doesn't install Art Of Reading, but it works very well with it.
	It is free, and now comes with embedded metadata,
