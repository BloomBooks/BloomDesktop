		<p class="indent"> Thanks for checking out this pre-release version of Bloom, which has been
			made available for experimentation and creation of shell books. It is not yet ready for
			wide-scale use. </p>
		<h2>Limitations</h2>
		<p>This version has the following limitations (and probably many others). Feel free to
			suggest your priorities, especially if you're contributing to the Bloom project in some
			way :-)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The font is always Andika (if you have it). <br />
				<span class="andikaFont" >This is Andika font, if available. Note the /a/ and
				/g/.</span><br/>
			<blockquote><p>Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another.
					</p>
					<p>A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than those of most serif fonts. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts that were not really suitable for beginning readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order to get all of the characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues.<br/>

			</blockquote>
				<span class="timesFont">This is Times New Roman font, if available. Note the /a/ and
					/g/.</span></li>
			<li>All books are A5 size. </li>
			<li>You can't control the cover color. </li>
			<li>Diglots are not supported. </li>
			<li>Right-To-Left languages are not supported (but I haven't seen what works and what
				doesn't)</li>
			<li>If you have a pdf reader other than Adobe Acrobat set up to display PDFs in Firefox,
				that will also show up in the Publish tab of Bloom, and it might or might not work.
				PDF-XChange, for exmample, can make the screen quite complicated with toolbars, and
				doesn't auto-shrink to fit in the page.</li>
			<li>You can't tweak the picture size, the text location, etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Things that don't work yet</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>When you open a page, the cursor should already be in the first editable box.</li>
			<li>When you're just filling out a shell, you shouldn't be able to change the
				pictures.</li>
			<li>There should be an obvious button for deleting books. Currently, you have to
				right-click to see a menu.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Known problems</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Some things are a lot slower than they need to be. These will be spead up in future
				versions.</li>
			<li> Sometimes the thumbnails for books and pages aren&#39;t drawn correctly.&nbsp;
				Pages thumbnails will be recreated the next time you show the book, but book
				thumbnails are cached. So if you get a bad thumbnail, you currently have to delete
				the &quot;thumbnail.png&quot; that you&#39;ll find sitting in the book&#39;s file
				folder.</li>
			<li> The Title Page and verso/copyright page are, well, they can only improve.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Reporting new problems</h2>
		<p>Please email problems to Bloom's issue tracking system at <a
				href="mailto:issues@bloom.palaso.org">issues@bloom.palaso.org</a></p>
		<h2>Got Art Of Reading?</h2>
		<p>Bloom doesn't install Art Of Reading, but it works very well with it. You can freely
			place AOR on any computer, without paying for it, according to its license. But you must
			only copy the pictures (which SIL owns), not the software (which is commercial). To do
			this, follow these steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a folder named "Art of Reading" at the root of your "C:\" drive.</li>
			<li>Copy the "Images" folder from the Art of Reading CD into that folder.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Now, when you click on an image in a book, Bloom will let you search for an AOR
			image.</p>
