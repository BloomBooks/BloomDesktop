Thanks for checking out this pre-release version of Bloom, which has been made availablef for experimentation and creation of shell books. It is not yet ready for wide-scale use.
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This version has the following limitations (and probably many others). Feel free to suggest your priorities, especially if you're contributing to the Bloom project in some way :-)</p>
<li>The font is always Andika (if you have it). </li>
<li>All books are A5 size. </li>
<li>You can't control the cover color. </li>
<li>You can't set the language preference for shells; Tok Pisin is your first choice, followed by English. </li>
<li>Diglots are not supported. </li>
<li>Right-To-Left languages are not supported (but I haven't seen what works and what doesn't)</li>

<h2>Things that don't work yet</h2>
<li>When you open a page, the cursor should already be in the first editable box.</li>
<li>When you change the title of a book, the label on the book, in the library, should change too.</li>
<li>When you change a picture, the thumbnail for the page should update.</li>
<li>When you're just filling out a shell, you shouldn't be able to change the pictures.</li>
<li>There should be an obvious button for deleting books and pages. Currently, you have to right-click to see a menu.</li>
</p>
<h2>Known problems</h2>
<li>Some things are a lot slower than they need to be.  These will be spead up in future versions.</li>
<h2>Reporting new problems</h2>
Please email problems to Bloom's issue tracking system at <a href="mailto:issues@bloom.palaso.org">issues@bloom.palaso.org</a>
<h2>Got Art Of Reading?</h2>
<p>Bloom doesn't install Art Of Reading, but it works very well with it.
You can freely place AOR on any computer, without paying for it, according to its license.
But you must only copy the pictures (which SIL owns), not the software (which is commercial).
To do this, follow these steps:
<p>1) Create a folder named "Art of Reading" at the root of your "C:\" drive.
<p>2) Copy the "Images" folder from the Art of Reading CD into that folder.</p>
Now, when you click on an image in a book, Bloom will let you search for an AOR image.
