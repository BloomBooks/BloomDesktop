<h1>Making New Shells</h1>
<p>The following instructions will guide you through making a basic Bloom shell which contains source text in a single language. At this time, Bloom doesn't have anything special for helping you make or distribute shells... that will come in the future.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For now, to make a basic shell, you just use Bloom as though you were making a new vernacular book. But instead of making the book in a vernacular library project, you make a library for the source language (e.g. "English").&nbsp; Then create a new book, using a paper/layout template like "A5 Portrait".</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create a Bloom libary for a national language</h3>
	<p>Create a new project, and check this option:</p>

	<p>Next, choose one of the national languages you&#39;ll be working with:</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create a new book from a template (e.g. A5 Portrait)</h3>

<h3>Step 3: Add all the pages of the book, with text in the national language</h3>
<p>Note: although Bloom supports multi-lingual shells, the Bloom user interface does
	not yet let you switch other languages (e.g., English and Tok Pisin).&nbsp; The
	way to do that for now is to quit bloom, open up the &quot;bloomLibary&quot; document in
	notepad, and change the iso639 code and languageName to that of another
	language.&nbsp; Save that, run Bloom again, and now you&#39;ll be adding a different
	national language to the same shells.</p>

<h2>Using the Shell</h2>
<p>In the future, we hope to have a nifty system of submitting and distributing shells, so that you can publish your collections and Bloom users can subscribe to them.  For now, we have nothing so fancy as that.</p>
<p>OK, so you have a one or more shells in a collection folder, perhaps in your &quot;My Documents/Bloom/my super collection&quot; folder. Now you want to test them out or give them to someone else to use. What you need to do is to move that collection folder to where Bloom looks for shell collections. On
	Vista and Windows 7, this is found at &quot;C:\Program Data\SIL\Bloom\Collections&quot;. On Windows XP, it is in
	&quot;C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SIL\Bloom\Collections&quot;. You can either copy your shell collection into this folder, or create a shortcut there which points to your collection.</p>
<p>On your own computer, just use the shortcut method. That way, you can open a vernacular library and test out your new shell, without having to move it around the computer.</p>
