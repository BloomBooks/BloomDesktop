<h1>Making New Shells</h1>
<p>The following (very minimal) instructions will guide you through making a basic Bloom shell which contains source text in a single language. At this time, Bloom doesn't have anything special for helping you make or distribute shells... that will come in the future.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For now, to make a basic shell, you just use Bloom as though you were making a new vernacular book. But instead of making the book in a vernacular library project, you make a library for the source language (e.g. "English").  Then create a new book, using a paper/layout template like "A5 Portrait".</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create a Bloom libary for a national language</h3>
<h3>Step 2: Create a new book from a template (e.g. A5 Portrait)</h3>
<h3>Step 3: Add all the pages of the book, with text in the national language</h3>
<p>Note: although Bloom supports multi-lingual shells, these instructions do not yet cover how to add other languages to the same shell (e.g., English and Tok Pisin).</p>

<h2>Using the Shell</h2>
<p>In the future, we hope to have a nifty system of subitting and distributing shells, so that you can publish your collections and Bloom users can subscribe to them.  For now, we have nothing so fancy as that.</p>
<p>To make the book available as a shell to other projects, you need to put the shell folder in the right place. Bloom looks in the "Program Data" folder of the computer; on Windows 7, this is found at "C:\Program Data". In there, you should see a folder named "Bloom" and inside that, one named "Collections". Now you have two choices: either copy your shell collection into this folder, or create a shortcut there which points to your collection.</p>
<p>On your own computer, just use the shortcut method. That way, you can open a vernacular library and test out your new shell, without having to move it around the comptuer.</p>
