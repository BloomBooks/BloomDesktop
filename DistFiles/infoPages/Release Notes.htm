<h1>Release Notes </h1>
<img src="construction.png"" />
<p class="indent" >
Thanks for checking out this pre-release version of Bloom, which has been made availablef for experimentation and creation of shell books. It is not yet ready for wide-scale use.
</p>
<h2>Got Art Of Reading?</h2>
<p>Bloom doesn't install Art Of Reading, but it works very well with it.
You can freely place AOR on any computer, without paying for it, according to its license.
But you must only copy the pictures (which SIL owns), not the software (which is commercial).
To do this, follow these steps:
<p>1) Create a folder named "Art of Reading" at the root of your "C:\" drive.
<p>2) Copy the "Images" folder from the Art of Reading CD into that folder.</p>
Now, when you click on an image in a book, Bloom will let you search for an AOR image.

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This version has the following limitations:
<li>The font is always Andika (if you have it). </li>
<li>All books are A5 size. </li>
<li>You can't control the cover color. </li>
<li>You can't set the language preference for shells; Tok Pisin is your first choice, followed by English. </li>
</p>
<h2>Known problems</h2>
<li>When printing or making PDFs, the pages are shrunk a couple centimters smaller than they should be.</li>
<li>If you click out of Bloom and then come back, sometimes it will ignore your typing. To get it paying attention again, click out of the text box, then back in.</li>
<li>Some things are a lot slower than they need to be.  These will be spead up in future versions.</li>
