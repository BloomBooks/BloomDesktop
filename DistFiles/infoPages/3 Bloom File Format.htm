<h1>Bloom Format</h1>
<p>The following information is for advanced primer or shell developers.  If you're just making shells for other people to use, you probably don't need to know any of the following.</p>
<p>
	Bloom is in experimental mode, and the Bloom format is still evolving in
	response to needs we discover. Take that into account before converting hundreds
	of books. The wise thing at this point it to convert one book of each type, so that we can find any missing file-format elements that you will need. The plan is to cease any breaking changes by early 2012.</p>
	<p>
Bloom documents are XHTML with certain conventions and pre-defined class names, as
	described below. Of course, you&#39;ll want to open up a bloom html file and see for
		yourself how it is structured.&nbsp; Two simple examples are the
		A5Portrait/templatePages.htm, and the Vaccinations.htm, which comes in the Sample Shells project. You can look at the originals or create a book using them,
		and look at what Bloom does.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Each page is indicated by &lt;div class="-bloom-page"&gt;. The only things that
	the user can edit are images and &lt;textarea&gt;s.&nbsp; There can be multiple
	&lt;textarea&gt;s together inside a &lt;p&gt;, each marked with a distinct <em>lang</em>
	attribute. Bloom will take care of only showing the user the correct &lt;textarea&gt;
	which matches the language the user is currently working in.</p>
	<h2>Formatting</h2>
	<p>Formatting within these pages is typically done by adding a unique class to the
	div for a particular page layout. That class then triggers the CSS style rules
	you&#39;ve made for the page.&nbsp; Using <a href="http://www.skybound.ca">Stylizer</a>,
	this can be much less painful that it sounds.&nbsp; It bears repeating: all of
	this is only for making <strong>new page templates</strong>, or for jobs (like fancy literacy
	primer templates) that can&#39;t use the standard page templates found in the
		A5Portrait Template.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>StyleSheets</h2>
<li>papersize/orientation. E.g. a5portrait.css. Currently, this is the only size/portrait available.</li><br/>
<p>The next three stylesheets are part of Bloom and are not available for customization under any circumstances.</p>
<li>basePage.css: always applied. Used for styles which always apply, regardless of mode or paper size.</li>
<li>editMode.css is applied during editing</li>
<li>previewMode.css is applied during viewing and printing</li>
	<p>Note: when a new book is created, each of these pages is copied in to the folder
		with the book, so that if it is moved to a computer which doesn&#39;t have bloom, it
		will be still viewable.&nbsp; However, each time the book is opened, Bloom will
		replace the stylesheets in that folder with the versions in the Bloom program
		directory.&nbsp; So if you&#39;re working on one of the standard stylesheets, be
		careful to not let Bloom over-write your work.</p>
<h2>Document Data</h2>
(TODO)<p>
		&lt;meta id=&quot;bookLineage&quot;
		content=&quot;name=A5Portrait;id=056B6F11-4A6C-4942-B2BC-8861E62B03B3&quot;/&gt;
		<br />
		&lt;meta id=&quot;bloomBookId&quot; content=&quot;056B6F11-4A6C-4942-B2BC-8861E62B03B4&quot;/&gt;</p>
&nbsp;<h2>Built-in Classes</h2>
<p>While most classes are just there to link with the CSS stylesheet, Bloom has several classes which the c# code looks for and uses:</p>
<li>-bloom-page: Each page is indicated by a &lt;div&gt; which has this class.</li>
<li>-bloom-vernacularBookTitle: This is shown on the cover, sets the &lt;title&gt; element of the html, sets the name of the book's folder, and finally, the book's html file.</li>
<li>-bloom-topicInNationalLanguage: e.g. "Health", "Math". Currently only used by stylesheets, but reserved for future c# code use.</li>
<li>-bloom-nameOfLanguage: this is automatically filled in, so it should only appear in uneditable elements.</li>
<li>-bloom-requiredPage: Page &lt;div&gt;s with this class are always added to a new book, and the user is not allowed to remove them. </li>
<li>-bloom-singleton: Only a single copy of this page may be added to a book.</li>
<li>-bloom-extraPage: When a book is created, any pages marked with this class will not be initially added to the new book. If the user wants one of these pages, he has to add it explicitly (by clicking on its icon in the list of template pages).</li>
<li>-bloom-showNational: indicates that it shouldn&#39;t be translated. See the section
	&quot;other language-related things&quot; below.</li>
<li>-bloom-guidOfTemplateBook.  See the section below on Lineage.</li>
<li>-bloom-pageLineage.  See the section below on Lineage.</li>
<h2>Lineage</h2>
<p>(This area is especially immature)</p>
<p>While Bloom doesn't yet provide it, we may someday need the ability to update all the pages stemming from a certain template page.  For example, an entity might change their standard title page format, and they might like to have a way of updating the existing books that were using the old format. To make that possible in the future, we need to store the lineage now.  Here's how it works at the moment:</p>

	&lt;a href=&quot;0151a8d0-8718-41f0-a7fb-71c6995fa80a;bfc0737c-f76a-4a34-93ba-d28cb483823a&quot; class=&#39;-bloom-pageLineage&#39;
	style=&#39;visibility:hidden&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br />
	<p>Notice that the href above has 2 guids (Globally Unique Identifiers), separated by a semicolon.  This tells us that this page came from a page with the id bfc0737c-f76a-4a34-93ba-d28cb483823a, which in turn came from a page with the id 0151a8d0-8718-41f0-a7fb-71c6995fa80a.</p>
	<p>Careful: if that closing tag is missing, everything following this will be
		invisible.</p>
	<h2>
		"Constants"</h2>
	<p>
		If a &lt;textarea&gt; has a class which begins with an underscore, Bloom will copy the text in that textarea into other paragraphs, spans, and textareas which have the same class. This allows the user to translate something once, and have it show up all over.
		For example, the following textarea is used in a study book, where many of the
		pages have a heading which, in English, just says &quot;Questions&quot;.</p>
	<p>
		&lt;textarea lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;Heading2 <span class="style1">_</span>questionsHeading&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/textarea&gt;</p>
&nbsp;<h2>
		Shell Books and Languages</h2>
	<p>
		Shell books may come with source texts in multiple languages, so that users in different countries or with different language strengths can use the source language which works best for them.</p>
	<p>
		So, how do we get all those languages in the same document? This area is still maturing. Currently, the approach is to surround each textarea
	in a p, then have one &lt;textarea&gt; for each source language. Each textarea must have
	its lang attibute set to a proper ISO639 (Ethnologue) code:</p>
	<p>
		&lt;p&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;textarea<span class="style2"> lang=&quot;tpi&quot;</span>&gt; &quot;Taim yu planim gaden yu save wokim
		banis.&lt;/textarea&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;textarea
		<span class="style2">lang=&quot;en&quot; </span>class=&quot;<span
			class="style2">hideMe</span>&quot;&gt; When you plant a garden,
		you always build a fence.&lt;/textarea&gt;<br />&lt;/p&gt;
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: the &#39;hideMe&#39; is currently used by Bloom to hide all but one language.&nbsp;
		In the future, we may instead use a dynamically-created css to turn languages on
		and off.</p>
	<p>
		Now, if Bloom makes a book using the above paragraph, it will make a new
		&lt;textarea&gt; for the vernacular; the resulting book will then have 3 textareas in
		this paragraph, with all but the vernacular containing the class &#39;hideMe&#39;.</p>
	<p>
		That &#39;hideMe&#39; class is just to keep the source texts out of the page in the
		browser. In <em>edit mode</em> the Bloom application still reads these
		&lt;textarea&gt;s, and shows the contents source-text pane, to help the user do his
		translation.</p>
		<h2>Other language-related things</h2>
		<p>Books in minority languages normally have some text that is in a language of wider communication. For example, the title of the book is often printed in the national language, below the vernacular one.&nbsp;
			To tell Bloom that we don&#39;t want to translate a text, we use the
			-bloom-showNational tag (REVIEW: this currently just means &quot;don&#39;t mess with this
			element&quot;; it doesn&#39;t do something smart like set the language to the local
			national language. This is fine if the shell was designed for this country.)</p>
	<p>&lt;textarea <span class="style1">lang=&quot;en&quot;</span> class=&quot;credits
		<span class="style1">-bloom-showNational</span>&quot;
		title=&quot;Enter the contributions made by writers, illustrators, editors, etc.&quot;
		id=&quot;df9d7385-8cfe-43d0-bfc2-6b3423a79954&quot;&gt; &lt;/textarea&gt;</p>
